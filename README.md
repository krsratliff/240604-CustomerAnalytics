# Overview
This repo contains my solution to the DataCamp project *Customer Analytics: Preparing Data for Modeling*.
# Files
- `customer_train.csv` contains the initial data which the project asks me to transform.
- `script.py` and `notebook-1.ipynb` each contain a copy of the solution.
  - `notebook-1.ipynb` displays intermediate and final results in the usual way.
  - `script.py` prints the intermediate results to a file `info.md` and stores the final result as `customer_train_transformed.csv`.
- `environment.yml` contains the conda environment `./envs` I used for this project.
